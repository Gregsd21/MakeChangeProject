#MakeChangeProject

## Description
This is my very first Java project while at SD. So this project is one that requires the user to act as a cashier handling a few transactions. The The goal is to provide change in the biggest bills & coins available to the customer after the transaction.


## What I learned
This project helped me to understand how to work with if statements and methods. Also I learned that a small mistake, such as not having > before = instead of = before > makes a huge difference in rounding off pennies when dealing with doubles. 

##Technologies Used
Java, Eclipse, Git, Github, and terminal.
